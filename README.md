# MC1350-LtSpice-Model
This repository contains an LtSpice model for the MC1350 RF/IF Amplifier IC based on schematic from datasheet. These ICs are used quite a lot in ham radio but all of my Googling has failed to find a model, which I wanted to use to understand the little airband scanner that I made.

The schematic below is based on one in the data sheet. I've also drawn the suggested test circuit and plotted a couple of graphs that feature in the datasheet - and they seem to match *reasonably well*.
